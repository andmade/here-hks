# Here@HKS - CS34 Final Project

## Description
While the proposed final project for this application is a mobile app, the prototype will be built as a web application. To simulate the phone experience, the prototype will be designed with a mobile interface using the Foundation framework. The data for the application will be based on real events taking place at the Harvard Kennedy School, although this data will be hardcoded as a database inside the application.
