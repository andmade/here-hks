        "description": "In this seminar, Sabrina Karim focuses on the role women have played in peacekeeping, arguing that increasing the number of women is important, but so are gender norms within peacekeeping missions. She demonstrates that in order to make peacekeeping missions more effective at protecting civilians in war torn countries, particular attention to gender is needed.",

        "description": "Most scholars believe that women of color suffer from double discrimination. They experience not only race but also gender discrimination, and that the intersection of race and gender can impart an additional penalty as well. Dr Kim examines earnings disparities by race, gender and the intersection of race and gender for African American and Asian women from 1980 to the present. She finds that African American women continue to suffer from gender and race discrimination, and that the intersection between gender and race imparts an additional third penalty as well. In other words, African American women suffer not only from double discrimination but from triple discrimination. While race disparities increased for African American women, they fell for Asian American women. Preliminary findings for Asian American women also indicate that Asian American suffer from an additional intersectional component as well.",

He is generally interested in questions of knowledge as they pertain to arms control and disarmament. While at Harvard, he will examine the making of open-source nuclear intelligence, and the role it plays in the framing of public narratives about weapons of mass destruction. Chris received his PhD in nuclear science and engineering at University of Michigan, where he developed novel neutron-spectroscopy techniques to characterize nuclear warheads for treaty verification. After finishing at Michigan, he was Stanton Nuclear Security Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center of International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University. There, he studied the history of North Korea’s pursuit of light water reactor technology, and the shifting role that pursuit played in its diplomacy.",

        "description": "Gender stereotypes persist in society. Many of these stereotypes are prescriptive, indicating how men and women should behave in social situations. However, an outstanding question is whether these normative gender beliefs apply equally to men and women of additional social categories. This work explores this question using an intersectional approach by asking participants to indicate the desirability of men, women, and people of different sexual orientations and races displaying a series of masculine and feminine traits. The results clearly show that although the category “man” and “woman” have different prescriptive stereotypes that haven’t substantively changed since 2002, race and sexual orientation substantively alter the landscape of these gendered stereotypes.These findings have implications for norm violation accounts of discrimination.",
